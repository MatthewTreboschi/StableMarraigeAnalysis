# StableMatchingAnalysis
The file was named stable marriage analysis before we moved on to hospitals and residents.
The Stable Marriage problem is a subset of the hospitals and residents problem where the amount of hospitals and residents are equal and every hospital only has 1 slot and every doctor/hospital ranks all others.

# Requires:

# Run instructions

  and the number of iterations you want the program to run
